You can also use a pattern such as C(0.0.2.2) and a mask such as C(0.0.255.255) (a reverse mask).,If a destination IP address matches more than one IP pattern, the pattern with the longest match is selected, and the associated virtual server processes the request. For example, if virtual servers C(vs1) and C(vs2) have the same IP pattern, C(0.0.100.128), but different IP masks of C(0.0.255.255) and C(0.0.224.255), a destination IP address of C(198.51.100.128) has the longest match with the IP pattern of vs1.
